				<p>I graduated and earned my Bachelor's Degree from <a href="http://www.bu.edu">Boston University</a> in May 2016.</p>
				<p>During my first two years of study, I devoted most of my academic time to studying Economics. My favorite topics are economics of the labor market, monetary and banking, and international economics. I am also interested in using demographical statistics and economics data to deduce possible explanations for causes of inequality and social conflicts. Studying economics sharpened my skills to work with data and statistics, and it also helped me develop strong quantitative problem solving skills.</p>
				<p>In my Junior year, I took my very first computer science class, and it opened my eyes to the world of computer technology. I was fascinated by the capacity of data processing and the possibility of creating new applications. Since then, I have decided to focus my study on computer science.</p>

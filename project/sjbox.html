		<div><h4>1. General Design</h4></div>
		<div class="container ml-4">
			<div>For this project, we designed a music streaming service using relational databases.</div>
			<div> </div>
			<div>We have a User table, which contains user’s information including unique uname(username), name, email, city, and password.</div>
			<div> </div>
			<div>We have a table for Artist, that contains artist id, artist name, and a short description. Each artist can perform multiple tracks. Each track has a tid, title, and duration. Each track can only be performed by one artist. Given the dataset provided, we decide to add a constraint that each track must be included in one album. And as a result, we remove the AlbumSong table from our previous design.</div>
			<div> </div>
			<div>Each user can create playlists, that has a playlist id, date, status (public/private), and title. A playlist can include tracks from different artist.</div>
			<div> </div>
			<div>We record information of each play of tracks by the users in the Play table. We keep track of the play time, and whether it is played from a playlist. When it is not played a playlist, we simply leave this information as NULL.</div>
			<div> </div>
			<div>Users can also gives a score between 0 to 10 for each track. Users can like artists, and follow other users. We store the timestamps of time when these actions taken place.</div>
			<div>  </div>
		</div>
		<br>

		<div class="container ml-4">
			
			<div>Functionality:</div>
			<b>
			<ul>
			 <li>Search tracks, albums, artists, or users</li>
			 <li>Access album info (including album title, artists, and release date), and all tracks in that album</li>
			 <li>Access track info (including artist, album, and duration) and play the track</li>
			 <li>Rate a track and access its average rating</li>
			 <li>Access artist info (including title, and description), all his/her albums and top tracks</li>
			 <li>Suggest similar artists based on the number of common fans (at least 3)</li>
			 <li>Like/unlike an artist</li>
			 <li>Follow/unfollow an user</li>
			 <li>Display a user’s profile, artists he/she likes, users he/she follows, and his/her playlists</li>
			 <li>Create playlists, which can be either public or private</li>
			 <li>Add/remove tracks into/from an playlist</li>
			 <li>Display a customized user feed, including new tracks by artists he/she liked, playlists by users he/she follows (ordered by number of plays), top 10 tracks by average user ratings, and top 10 tracks by number of plays</li>
			</ul>

		<div class="container ml-4">
			<div>This is the ER diagram of our design.</div>
			<div><img src="../images/project/sjbox/Picture1.png" width="85%" height="85%"/><br/></div>
			<div><br/></div>
			<div><br/></div>
			<div> </div>
			<div>Here is the database schema we created:</div>
			<br>
			<b>
			<div>User(Username, Name, Email, City, Password)</div>
			<div>Artist(ArtistId, ArtistTitle, ArtistDescription)</div>
			<div>Track(TrackId, TrackName, TrackDuration, TrackArtist, TrackAlbum)</div>
			<div>Album(AlbumId, AlbumName, AlbumReleaseDate)</div>
			<div>Playlist(PlaylistId, Username, PlaylistTitle, PlaylistDate, PlaylistStatus)</div>
			<div>Follow(Username1, Username2, FollowDate)</div>
			<div>Likes(ArtistId, Username, LikeDate)</div>
			<div>Rate(Username, TrackId, Score, RateTime)</div>
			<div>Play(Username, TrackId, PlayTime, PlaylistId)</div>
			<div>PlaylistSong(PlaylistId, TrackId)</div>
			</b>
			
			<br>
			<div>Foreign key constraints:</div>
			<b>
			<div>Track.TrackArtist is a foreign key referencing Artist.ArtistTitle.</div>
			<div>Track.AlbumId is a foreign key referencing Album.AlbumId.</div>
			<div>Playlist.Username is a foreign key referencing User.Username.</div>
			<div>Follow.Username1 is a foreign key referencing User.Username.</div>
			<div>Follow.Username2 is a foreign key referencing User.Username.</div>
			<div>Likes.ArtistId is a foreign key referencing Artist.ArtistId.</div>
			<div>Likes.Username is a foreign key referencing User.Username.</div>
			<div>Rate.Username is a foreign key referencing User.Username.</div>
			<div>Rate.TrackId is a foreign key referencing Track.TrackId.</div>
			<div>Play.Username is a foreign key referencing User.Username.</div>
			<div>Play.TrackId is a foreign key referencing Track.TrackId.</div>
			<div>Play.PlaylistId is a foreign key referencing Playlist.PlaylistId.</div>
			<div>PlaylistSong.PlaylistId is a foreign key referencing Playlist.PlaylistId.</div>
			<div>PlaylistSong.TrackId is a foreign key referencing Track.TrackId.</div>
			</b>

			<div>Assumptions:</div>
			<ol start="1" type="1">
			 <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;">An artist can have multiple tracks, and a track can only belong to one artist.</li>
			 <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;">A track must belongs to an album.</li>
			 <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;">A user can only follow the same user, like the same artist, or rate the same track at most once.</li>
			 <li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2;">In Follow table, u1 follows u2.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div><h4>3. Implementation details</h4></div>
		<div class="container ml-4">
			<div>We use LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) for the implementation of this application.</div>
			<div><br/></div>
			<div><b>User session and URLs:</b></div>
			<div>We use PHP’s session functionality to maintain user session. If the user has not logged in, we disallow the user to access other pages and redirect the user to login page.</div>
			<br>
			<div>For URLs, we use get method for pages that contains publicly accessible information so that users can easily create bookmarks. These pages include user profile pages, search pages, track pages, artist pages, album pages, and playlist pages.</div>
			<br>
			<div>For other operations that contains confidential information, we use POST method to hide information and make sure the same operation won’t be repeated. These operations include to login, to register, to create playlist, to add a song to the playlist, to follow a user, to like an artist, to rate a track, etc.</div>
			<br>

			<div><b>SQL injection prevention:</b></div>
			<div>To prevent SQL injection attacks, we used prepared statements to process all the SQL queries that requires user inputs.</div>
			<br>
			<div><b>Cross-site script prevention:</b></div>
			<div>To prevent Cross-site script attacks, whenever we need to output print user inputs or store them in the database, such as register an account and create new playlist, we use htmlspecialchars() function to preprocess the input strings. Therefore, all malicious inputs will have their special characters removed and won’t be able to be executed as code.</div>
			<br>
			<div><b>Concurrence:</b></div>
			<div>In our design, all users have to login before they can use the application. Therefore, all the reads and writes made by the user are specific to that user account and won’t affect other users. For example, the write operations we have are to register new account, to create new playlist, to follow another user, to like an artist, to rate a track, and to add/remove a track to the user’s playlist. These operations all involve current user’s id and therefore won’t conflict with other users operations. Furthermore, these operations are all atomic and do not involve multiple steps. If an operation fails, there is no need to rollback because there is no intermediate step.</div>

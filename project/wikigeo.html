    <p>WikiGeo is a class project that I developed with my teammates for CS411: Software Engineering in Spring 2016 at Boston University.</p>

	<p>
    The basic idea behind this application is to help people learn more about
    the places near them. For example, when you travel to a new city, you might
    get curious about the places that you are visiting. What kind of monuments 
    are there? Did any historical events happen around the area? When you have
    these kinds of questions, WikiGeo is here to help!
    <br>
    <br>
    This web application use geolocation and find where the user currently is,
    then it will display an interactive map showing markers of historical events 
    or monuments nearby. By clicking on the marker, a detailed description and 
    pictures of that specific event/monument will pop up, and the user can then 
    learn more about that location.
    <br>
    <br>
    We also include the feature that allows users to create their own markers of
    the locations they know. They can create a discription and upload photos of
    the place. This marker will then become public and be shared with other 
    users in the community.

	<h2>How to Use this App?</h2>
	<p><i>Below is a quick guide.</i></p>

	<img src="../images/project/wikigeo/main-interface.jpg" alt="main interface" width="85%" height="85%" />
	</center>
	<p>
    When you log in to the app, here is the main page you will see. 
    By default, the search area will be your current location.
    You can also change your search area 
    by moving the little black circle on the map. The circle will move to place 
    you clicked, and it updates the searching area. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Whenever you are lost on the map, you can always go back to 
    your current location by simply clicking "Show my location" button, 
    and it will bring you back to your current location.

	<h2>Technical Stuff</h2>
	<p>
	This web application is developed using MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js).
	We use Google Maps API to acquire user's geolocation and cross reference the geolocation
	with the data pulled from wikipedia API. The result is then displayed on an interactive
	Google Map.
